# RedMonk
Red Monk is a general Android assistant application for diabetics. :rose:

The application allows to store and periodically change user physical stats, keep track of their medication schedule, calorie consumption, maintain a list of medical contacts and setup emergency buttons (as widgets) to quicky contact them.

Project Status: <b>ALPHA</b> :wrench:

This project is under heavy development. It is useable, but most of the features aren't refined it and some are still missing.

Minimal API 16
Using https://github.com/kanytu/Android-studio-material-template as template

Looks best with Material Design!
